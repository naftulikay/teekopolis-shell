# teekopolis-shell

All of my Bash, Powerline, Tmux, and IPython configuration scripts so I can effectively manage their lifecycle.

## Installing

Run `make install` to install everything to your homedir. Or not, don't do that.

## Dependencies

I'm still old-school and use Python 2.7, so if you want an old IPython, do the following to make things work with the
configuration provided here:

```
sudo pip install ipython
sudo pip install powerline-status
```

This is required because certain distros like Fedora ship with a default Python of 3.5.
